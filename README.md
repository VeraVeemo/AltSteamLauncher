An alternate to the current steam launcher, with its own UI all in Python!

If you are getting unknown packages, run the "Package Installer.py" file, and it'll install all the required packages for you!

You can use my API Token Key if you don't want to do all the Web API Token, the Token is provided already in the Release, but it's "<ins>8217EC6F4284568216E31EA3DA143F13</ins>"!<br>I don't recommend using mine for long though, it will get Rate Limited if multiple people use it! So here's the link to make your OWN Web API Token! https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

There's a logger, and it is in files/output.txt if you want to debug!

If you need help, message AVeemo on discord:

Run "AlternateSteamLauncher.pyw" to run the program, or run "AlternateSteamLauncher-CONSOLE.py" to launch the program with a console!
