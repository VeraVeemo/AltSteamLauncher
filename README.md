An alternate to the current steam launcher, with its own UI all in Python!

If you are getting unknown packages, run the "Package Installer.py" file, and it'll install all the required packages for you!

You can use my API Token Key if you don't wanna do all the Web API Token, the Token is provided already in the Release but it's "<ins>8217EC6F4284568216E31EA3DA143F13</ins>"!<br>I don't recommended using mine for long though, it will get Rate Limited if multiple people use it! So here's the link to make your OWN Web API Token! : https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

If you need help, message AVeemo on discord:

Run "main.py" to run the program!

###### Made in Python 3.13.5, PyCharm Profressional 2025.1.3.1
